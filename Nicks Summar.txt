Created two seperate folders,
	1 for original version
	2 for CMS version
Created express
added npm to project

Port number will be 3001
	- I did this cause in the past I had trouble sometime with getting things to work
	smoothly in other projects that all wanted to run on 3000, I run into less problems.
	
.gitignore added for node_modules

Created OriginalVersion branch just incase.

moved all html file to proper location in view and changed them to .ejs
